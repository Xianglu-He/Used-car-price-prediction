# Used-car-price-prediction
This prediction model includes listed BMW cars for sell, the features in each car and the recommended sell price. We are going to use these features as variable to build machine learning models to predict the recommended sell price
This PDF generated by R markdown contains two Machine learning models (MLR and SVM)
MLR: 
In specific, MLR has 68 % in-sample prediction but only 64% out-of-sample prediction. It has good descriptive abilities but poor predictive powers. 
SVM:
On the other hand, SVM gives 79% in-sample prediction and 77.4% out-of-sample prediction. It performs better than the MLR model.
